### Customizing Studio

When you enter a Studio, Chef Habitat will attempt to locate `/src/.studiorc` and
source it. Think `~/.bashrc`. This file can be used to export any
environment variables like the ones you see above as well as any other shell
customizations to help you develop your plans from within the Studio.

To use this feature, place a `.studiorc` in the current working directory
where you will run `hab studio enter`.

Note that a `.studiorc` will only be source when using `hab studio enter`--it will not be sourced when calling `hab studio run` or `hab studio build` (also `hab pkg build`).
